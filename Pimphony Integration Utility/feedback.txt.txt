=> 1. HM, just reopen the NewCallForm
Ok, otherwise i have tried it, all works fine apart from one thing - when it reopens the form it closes down all other forms. So the new call form is open but it closes the front page form...? Do you have any ideas around this?

=>2. Create the modification to not intercept argument 3, but makes it as the access modification. So the 1st issue is solved :D
Maybe I will the need the setup utility for this.

Hey, whoo...take that back. It doesn't close the other forms, they were just hiding behind it.

One other little change. If it is an INT call (which i think might be argument 3) could we not open the NewCall form. At the moment i only want it to open for an external call. Hopefully this changes the access code rather than the application code as in the future i do want to capture internal calls but opening a different form.

I hope this makes sense...???

cheers!

=>3.
Ahh...i have discovered that this is still a problem:

The only reason it looked like it was starting to work was i set the Front Page to open as the default form when the database was opened.

Do you follow where i'm coming from?
